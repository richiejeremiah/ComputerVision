# Project Overview and Objectives

The main purpose of this project was to use computer vision to detect brain tumors in MRI Scans. In order to do this the scans were annotated using the VGG Image Annotator and the a deep learning model was developed using the Mask R-CNN model architechture. The dataset containted few images hence this project didn't focus on model accuracy as it was clear that the model would not have performed well due to small dataset however this project shows how to build such model.
